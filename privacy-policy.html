          <h2>Privacy Policy and GDPR statement</h2>
          
          <p>The EU Personal Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is enshrined in UK Law under the Data Protection Act 2018 and enforced by the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO).</p>
          
          <p>This page explains to you how we collect, store and use personal data belonging to anyone that uses our facilities. BATTS TableTennis Club is the data controller for a number of digital services and systems that work together to provide a safe and enjoyable experience for all.</p>

          <h2>CCTV image and video</h2>
          <p>BATTS is equipped with a modern CCTV system that runs 24/7, capturing most areas of the centre.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What information does it collect?</strong> The system records the actions of users in the main areas of our centre.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Why?</strong> The system is in place for the benefit of all people that enter our building. It provides additional security for our members and staff, and their property.</p>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>Membership Registration Form</h2>
          <p>To sign up for BATTS membership, a registration form is needed. Paper copies of the form are available as well as an online version that is included on the BATTS website's Membership page.</p>
          
          <p><strong>What information does it collect?</strong></p>
          <p>The membership form asks for the following information:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Full name</li>
            <li>Date of birth</li>
            <li>Address</li>
            <li>Phone Number</li>
            <li>Secondary phone number (in case of an emergency)</li>
            <li>Email address</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>The parent/carer/guardian of Juniors are also required to provide:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>their full name</li>
            <li>their child's school or college</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>Members are asked whether they give permission for photo/video content to be taken of them, or of their child if the member is under 18. See the section below for details.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Why?</strong> We collect this information for use in club operations. These include to communicate with members and staff via our club channels: email, direct contact through telephone calls and SMS, in case of an emergency to contact the member's or staff's parent/carer/guardian or secondary contact or simply to improve our services.</p>
          
          <p>For example, because we have relationships with local schools, we're able to identify the school's in which our Juniors attend. This gives us an indication of what areas we could expand. Collecting date of birth allows us to manage the club's membership categories, events and initiatives that are age related.</p>

          <h2>Table Tennis England Membership</h2>
          <p>All members must have TableTennis England membership (which is free for if you do not play competitions) this includes an insurance policy for any accidents. BATTS Table Tennis Club is proudly affiliated to Table Tennis England (our sport's governing body) as a Premier Club.</p>
          
          <p>As part of club membership registration, and to fulfil our requirements as a Premier Club, all BATTS members must register for Table Tennis England membership too. TableTennis England's website explains the different types of membership and the benefits that are offered as part of it.</p>
          
          <p><a href="https://www.tabletennisengland.co.uk/membership/choose-membership/" target="_blank">https://www.tabletennisengland.co.uk/membership/choose-membership/</a></p>
          
          <p>Like BATTS, Table Tennis England collects information from its members upon initial registration, which is stored within Table Tennis England's internal systems. You should see Table Tennis England's website for more details on how they use and process member's data.</p>
          
          <p>It is important to note that when someone registers for Table Tennis England's membership, they are asked to identify the clubs and leagues which they attend and/or play for. If 'BATTS Table Tennis Club (Essex -2009)' is selected as a club, then the member's TTE information is automatically shared with BATTS. We are then able to see the status of each member's Table Tennis England membership which would be required when organising a tournament at BATTS, for example, in entering teams into one of Table tennis England's formats such as the British League or National Junior and Cadet Leagues.</p>

        <div class="privacy-section">
          <h2>Photo and Video Content of Members</h2>
          <p>Our club membership registration form asks the member or parent/carer/guardian whether they give permission for photo/video content to be taken of them.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Why?</strong> If the relevant permission is in place, we may use photo and video for club publicity and marketing purposes through our various platforms such as our club website, social media, and even publicity for the local newspaper. This allows us to advertise our services and reach an audience of potential centre users in the local area.</p>
